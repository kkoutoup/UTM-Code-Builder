# UTM Link Builder
A single page app that helps people build UTM links allowing for more effective GA tracking.

## Category
Google Analytics/Ad campaigns/Social Media

## Purpose
Help my team's members create UTM links for ad campaigns across different platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Social Shorthand etc.) in a robust way. The aim of the app is to produce the links based on user input and perform  robust error checking to ensure outputs are correct. This is crucial for ad campaign performance monitoring as errors in the UTM link structure will make it impossible to track campaigns and compare performance.

## User needs
The app needs to be simple, intuitive with minimal dependencies so it can be used by of people of different, in some cases non-technical, backgrounds. Therefore it is a single HTML page built with Bootstrap and vanilla JS for error checking and link production.

## Dependencies
Built with HTML, SASS, JS and Bootstrap
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
